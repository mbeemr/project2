# Maria's Analysis of Fun Stuff to Do 
Text goes here to say what will be in this section.  it will include lots of stuff

## Maria Fun (header 1 level down)
Putting my ordered list here.  **Things I wish I could have more time to do more often**
Right now these are just numbers.  I think maybe they should all be 1s.
  1.golfing
  2.running
     * long runs
     * races
  3.skiing
  4.hiking
  5.swimming

### Maria's Son's Fun (subheader 2 levels down)
This is a test to see if I understand levels of headers.
Now here is an unordered list of activities _I wish the boys would try to do_
* making friends
* going for hikes
* riding their bikes

## Maria sub-headerB 1 level down - NOT fun
why did it go purple
* video games
  * especially shooting games
  * and those with annoying voices
